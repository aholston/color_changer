This is an optional assignment that I completed at Coding Dojo using Python and Flask

The requirements for this project are as follows:

Create an app whose background changes color depending on values entered by the user. You will need one route to load your html template and another to handle form submission.

Consider how you might be able to insert a color value into a template to effect the entire background of an entire page.

I realized when I turned this in that I could have easily just used RGB values, for some reason I was thinking that I couldn't. Leaving this up because it's a cool way to change RGB to Hex.
